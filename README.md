## Description

This project aims to develop a plant disease recognition model based on leaf image classification using deep convolutional networks. The model can recognize<strong> 38 different types of plant diseases from 14 different plants and distinguish plant leaves from their surroundings. The real-time response is 0.1 seconds.</strong>

## Leaf Image Classification

### <img src="./Assets/batch.png" alt="batch of image"/>

This process involves building a model to detect diseases associated with leaf images. The key points are:

1. **Data Gathering**: The dataset used is **"New Plant Diseases Dataset"**. It can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset). It contains images of different healthy and unhealthy crop leaves.
<br>

2. **Model Building**:
   - The model is built using PyTorch.
   - Three models were used:
     1. CNN model architecture includes <strong>CNN Layer, Max Pooling, Flatten, and Linear Layers</strong>.
     2. Transfer learning with <strong>VGG16 Architecture</strong>.
     3. Transfer learning with <strong>ResNet34 Architecture</strong>.
<br>

3. **Training**: The model was trained using variants of the layers mentioned above and by varying hyperparameters. The best model achieved a test <strong>accuracy of 98.42%.</strong>
<br>

4. **Testing**: The model was tested on 17,572 images of 38 classes. Sample predictions can be seen below:

5. **Model Architectures and Performance**: Various model architectures, learning rates, and optimizers were tried, with different accuracy levels obtained.

## Details about the Model

The model can detect `38` types of `diseases` in `14 unique plants`.
